Hidden Konami JS
=========

## What is this?
[konami-js](https://github.com/snaptortoise/konami-js) is a nice little library that lets you add a secret function to your website, which is called when you type in the [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code).  I love using this to sneak little easter eggs into my projects, but I've always had a few complaints.
* You can't customize the input code that reveals the secret
* The input code and secret function are plainly visible in the page source, so they are easy to find reveal

Basically, this fork sacrifices touchscreen support to allow customization of patterns.

## Why would you want that?
Maybe you want your website to do something special, but you don't want it to be immediately obvious what the pattern is upon inspection of the source. Using MD5 is cheap and good enough for this, and it would be funny to see someone try and find a collision just to find out the pattern.

### You realize everyone can see the code the pattern executes anyway, right? This doesn't hide that.
Actually, that only just occured to me.  Damn.  *thinks furiously*

Two options immediately present themselves:
* Obfuscate or minify the Javascript you want to execute (trivial to beautify) or...
* You could, once the pattern is recognized, append something, calculate a new hash, and use that hash to get new code from the server.  Perhaps the easiest way to do this would be to have a .js file named with the new hash, with some function name we expect, which we then import and call.  I've implemented this one in the absence of recognizing a better solution.

## Demo
See the bundled index.html, konami.js, and md5.min.js files.
* Between these files, you are only presented a hash and the length of the pattern.
* You cannot determine the magic pattern from this information alone (ignoring collisions)
* When the pattern is recognized another hash is created, which loads and executes the next .js file:

The d3207cc4375db28d31757a64ffecbd51.js file contains the easter egg payload.
* This file is not obfuscated, so the payload is secured through obscurity alone.
* Presumably this is hosted on a server where visitors cannot simply see the whole directory of files.
* Knowing this hash, a vistor will know the end result of the easter egg but cannot determine the pattern needed to reach there ordinarily (ignoring collisions).

## This is not secure
You are correct.  Please do not use this to secure anything actually important.  This is just meant to be a simple way to make some dumb secret jokes on your website, which can (mostly) only be discovered or spread by word-of-mouth.  This was a random idea of mine and I just wanted to see if I can get it to work.
